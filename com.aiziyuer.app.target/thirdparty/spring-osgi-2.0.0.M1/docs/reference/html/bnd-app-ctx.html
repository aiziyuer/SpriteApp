    section 3.2 of the OSGi Service Platform Core Specification). A bundle
    known to the OSGi runtime is in one of three steady states: installed,
    resolved, or active. Bundles may export services (objects) to the OSGi
    service registry, and by so doing make these services available for other
    bundles to discover and to use. Bundles may also export Java packages,
    enabling other bundles to import the exported types.</p><p>In Spring the primary unit of modularity is an <span class="emphasis"><em>application context</em></span>,
    which contains some number of beans (objects managed by the Spring
    application context). Application contexts can be configured in a
    hierarchy such that a child application context can see beans defined in a
    parent, but not vice-versa. The Spring concepts of exporters and factory
    beans are used to export references to beans to clients outside of the
    application context, and to inject references to services that are defined
    outside of the application context.</p><p>There is a natural affinity between an OSGi bundle and a Spring
    application context. Using Spring Dynamic Modules, an active bundle may
    contain a Spring application context, responsible for the instantiation,
    configuration, assembly, and decoration of the objects (beans) within the
    bundle. Some of these beans may optionally be exported as OSGi services
    and thus made available to other bundles; beans within the bundle may also
    be transparently injected with references to OSGi services.</p><p>This chapter describes the lifecycle relationship between bundles and their 
    application contexts, as imposed by Spring DM based on the events occurring at runtime,
    inside an OSGi environment.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="bnd-app-ctx:extender"></a>6.1.&nbsp;The Spring Dynamic Modules Extender Bundle</h2></div></div></div><div class="sidebar"><a name="extender-pattern"></a><p class="title"><b>Extender Pattern</b></p><p>A common pattern in OSGi applications is the <span class="emphasis"><em>extender</em></span>, that

		entry for an in-depth explanation.
		</p></div><p>The component responsible for detecting the <span class="emphasis"><em>Spring-powered bundles</em></span> and instantiating 
      their application context is the Spring DM <span class="emphasis"><em>extender</em></span>. It serves the same purpose as the <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/webintegration.html" target="_top">ContextLoaderListener</a>
      does for Spring web applications. Once the extender bundle is installed
      and started it looks for any existing Spring-powered bundles that are
      already in the <span class="emphasis"><em>ACTIVE</em></span> state and creates application contexts on their
      behalf. In addition, it listens for bundle starting events and
      automatically creates an application context for any Spring-powered
      bundle that is subsequently started. <a href="app-deploy.html#app-deploy:headers" title="7.1.&nbsp;Bundle Format And Manifest Headers">Section&nbsp;7.1, &#8220;Bundle Format And Manifest Headers&#8221;</a>
      describes what the extender recognizes as a "Spring-powered bundle" while 
      <a href="app-deploy.html#app-deploy:extender-configuration" title="7.3.&nbsp;Extender Configuration Options">Section&nbsp;7.3, &#8220;Extender Configuration Options&#8221;</a> how the extender can be configured.
      The extender monitors the lifecycle of the bundle it manages and will destroy automatically the contexts for bundles
      that are stopped. When the extender bundle itself is stopped, it will automatically close all the contexts that it manages,
      based on the service dependency between them.
      The extender bundle symbolic name is <code class="literal">org.springframework.osgi.extender</code>. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="bnd-app-ctx:app-creation"></a>6.2.&nbsp;Application Context Creation</h2></div></div></div><p>Once started, the extender analyses the existing started bundles and monitors any new bundle that will start. Once a
      Blueprint or Spring-DM configuration is detected, the extender will create an application context for it in an asynchronous manner,
      on a different thread then the one starting the bundle (or delivering the STARTED event).
      This behaviour follows the OSGi specification recommendation and ensures that starting an OSGi Service Platform is fast and that 
      bundles with service inter-dependencies do not cause deadlock (waiting for each other) on startup, as pictured below: </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/start-diagram.png" align="middle" alt="Application Context Sequence Diagram"></div><p>The extender considers only bundles successfully started, that is, bundles in 
      <span class="emphasis"><em>ACTIVE</em></span> state; bundles in other states are ignored.    
      Therefore a Spring-powered/Blueprint bundle will have its application context created <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span>
      it has been fully started. It is possible to force synchronous/serialized creation of application contexts 
      for started bundles, on a bundle-by-bundle basis. See <a href="app-deploy.html#app-deploy:headers" title="7.1.&nbsp;Bundle Format And Manifest Headers">Section&nbsp;7.1, &#8220;Bundle Format And Manifest Headers&#8221;</a> for information 
      on how to specify this behaviour.</p><p>If application context creation fails for any reason then the
      failure cause is logged. The bundle remains in the ACTIVE state; the application context lifecycle will not influence
      the bundle lifecycle in anyway. Naturally, since the context has failed, so will the functionality associated with it;
      for example there will be no services exported to the registry from the application context in this scenario.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bnd-app-ctx:app-creation:mandatory-deps"></a>6.2.1.&nbsp;Mandatory Service Dependencies</h3></div></div></div><p>If an application context declares mandatory availability for certain
        imported OSGi services, the creation of the application context is blocked 
        until all the mandatory dependencies can be satisfied through matching services 
        available in the OSGi service registry. In practice, for most enterprise applications
        built using Spring Dynamic Modules services, the set of available
        services and bundles will reach a steady state once the platform and
        its installed bundles are all started. In such a world, the behaviour of
        waiting for mandatory dependencies simply ensures that bundles A and
        B, where bundle A depends on services exported by bundle B, may be
        started in any order.</p><p>A timeout applies to the wait for mandatory dependencies to be
        satisfied. By default the timeout is set to 5 minutes, but this value
        can be configured using the <code class="literal">timeout</code> directive. See
        <a href="app-deploy.html#app-deploy:headers" title="7.1.&nbsp;Bundle Format And Manifest Headers">Section&nbsp;7.1, &#8220;Bundle Format And Manifest Headers&#8221;</a> for details.</p><p>Blueprint users could achieve the same result through the <code class="literal">blueprint.timeout</code> 
		attribute declared on the <code class="literal">Bundle-SymbolicName</code></p><p>It is possible to change the application context creation
        semantics so that application context creation fails if all mandatory
        services are not immediately available upon startup (see the aforementioned 
        section for more information).
        Again, note that regardless of the configuration chosen, the failure of the
        application context will not change the bundle state.</p><p>For more information on the <span class="emphasis"><em>availability</em></span> of imported services,
        see <a href="service-registry.html#service-registry:refs:availability" title="8.2.1.&nbsp;Imported Service Availability">Section&nbsp;8.2.1, &#8220;Imported Service Availability&#8221;</a></p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bnd-app-ctx:app-creation:app-ctx-publication"></a>6.2.2.&nbsp;Application Context Service Publication</h3></div></div></div><p>Once the application context creation for a bundle has
        completed, the application context object is automatically exported as
        a service available through the OSGi Service Registry. The context is
        published under the interface
        <code class="interfacename">org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext</code> (and
        also all of the visible super-interfaces and types implemented by the
        context). The published service has a service property named
        <code class="literal">org.springframework.context.service.name</code> whose
        value is set to the bundle symbolic name of the bundle hosting the
        application context. In case of a Blueprint bundle, the container will be published
        under <code class="interfacename">org.osgi.service.blueprint.container.BlueprintContainer</code>
        while the bundle symbolic name will be published under <code class="literal">osgi.blueprint.container.symbolicname</code>
        property. 
        </p><p>It is possible to prevent publication of the
        application context as a service using a directive in the bundle's
        manifest. See <a href="app-deploy.html#app-deploy:headers" title="7.1.&nbsp;Bundle Format And Manifest Headers">Section&nbsp;7.1, &#8220;Bundle Format And Manifest Headers&#8221;</a> for details.</p><p>Note: the application context is published as a service
        primarily to facilitate testing, administration, and management.
        Accessing this context object at runtime and invoking
        <code class="literal">getBean()</code> or similar operations is discouraged. The
        preferred way to access a bean defined in another application context
        is to export that bean as an OSGi service from the defining context,
        and then to import a reference to that service in the context that
        needs access to the service. Going via the service registry in this
        way ensures that a bean only sees services with compatible versions of
        service types, and that OSGi platform dynamics are respected.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="bnd-app-ctx:bnd-lifecycle"></a>6.3.&nbsp;Bundle Lifecycle</h2></div></div></div><p>OSGi is a dynamic platform: bundles may be installed, started,
      updated, stopped, and uninstalled at any time during the running of the
      framework.</p><p>When an active bundle is stopped, any services it exported during
      its lifetime are automatically unregistered and the bundle returns to
      the resolved state. A stopped bundle should release any resources it has
      acquired and terminate any threads. Packages exported by a stopped
      bundle continue to be available to other bundles.</p><p>A bundle in the resolved state may be uninstalled: packages that
      were exported by an uninstalled bundle continue to be available to
      bundles that imported them (but not to newly installed bundles).A bundle 
      in the resolved state may also be updated. The update
      process migrates from one version of a bundle to another version of the
      same bundle.</p><p>Finally of course, a resolved bundle can be started, which
      transitions it to the active state.</p><p>The diagram below represents the bundle states and its transitions:</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/bundle-states.png" align="middle" alt="Bundle States"></div><p>The OSGi <code class="literal">PackageAdmin</code>
      <code class="literal">refreshPackages</code> operation refreshes packages across
      the whole OSGi framework or a given subset of installed bundles. During
      the refresh, an application context in an affected bundle will be
      stopped and restarted. After a <code class="literal">refreshPackages</code>
      operation, packages exported by older versions of updated bundles, or
      packages exported by uninstalled bundles, are no longer available.
      Consult the OSGi specifications for full details.</p><p>When a Spring-powered or Blueprint bundle is stopped, the application context
      created for it is automatically destroyed. All services exported by the
      bundle will be unregistered (removed from the service registry) and the
      normal application context tear-down life-cycle is observed
      (<code class="interfacename">org.springframework.beans.factory.DisposableBean</code> implementors 
      and <code class="literal">destroy-method</code>
      callbacks are invoked on beans in the context).</p><p>If a Spring-powered bundle that has been stopped is subsequently
      re-started, a new application context will be created for it.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="bnd-app-ctx:osgi-resource"></a>6.4.&nbsp;The Resource Abstraction</h2></div></div></div><p>The Spring Framework defines a resource abstraction for loading
      resources within an application context (see <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/resources.html" target="_top">Spring's
      resource abstraction</a>). All resource loading is done through the
      <code class="interfacename">org.springframework.core.io.ResourceLoader</code> associated with the application
      context. The <code class="interfacename">org.springframework.core.io.ResourceLoader</code> is also 
      available to beans wishing to load resources programmatically. Resource paths with
      explicit prefixes - such as <code class="literal">classpath:</code> - are treated uniformly
      across all application context types (for example, web application
      contexts and classpath-based application contexts). Relative resource
      paths are interpreted differently based on the type of application
      context being created. This enables easy integration testing outside
      the ultimate deployment environment.</p><p>OSGi 4.0.x specification defines three different spaces from which a
	  resource can be loaded. Spring DM supports all of them through its dedicated OSGi-specific
	  application context and dedicated prefixes:</p><div class="table"><a name="osgi-search-strategies"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;6.1.&nbsp;OSGi resource search strategies</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table summary="OSGi resource search strategies" width="100%" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>OSGi Search Strategy</th><th>Prefix</th><th>Explanation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Class Space</td><td><code class="literal">classpath:</code></td><td>Searches the bundle classloader (the bundle, all imported packages and required bundles).

This scope is relevant for
      beans exported as an OSGi service and can be described as <span class="emphasis"><em>one instance per bundle</em></span>. 
      Beans exported as OSGi service, that have <code class="literal">bundle</code> scope, will result in a different instance created for 
      each unique bundle that imports the service through the OSGi service registry. Consumers of the same bundle (whether defined
      through Spring DM or not) will see the same bean instance. When a bundle has stopped importing the bundle (for whatever reason),
      the bean instance is disposed.
	  To the declaring bundle, a <code class="literal">bundle</code>-scoped bean behaves just like a singleton (i.e. there is only
	  one instance per bundle, including the declaring one).This contract lifecycle is similar to that of the 
	  <code class="interfacename">org.osgi.framework.ServiceFactory</code> interface.</p><p>For more information regarding service publication and consumption, see <a href="service-registry.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;The Service Registry">Chapter&nbsp;8, <i xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The Service Registry</i></a>.</p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Important"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Important]" src="images/admons/important.png"></td><th align="left">Important</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">The bundle scope is relevant, only if the declaring bean is consumed through the OSGi service registry.

      access to the OSGi <code class="interfacename">BundleContext</code> object for your
      bundle, then Spring makes this easy to do.</p><p>The OSGi application context created by the Spring extender will
      automatically contain a bean of type <code class="interfacename">BundleContext</code>
      and with name <code class="literal">bundleContext</code>. You can inject a
      reference to this bean into any bean in the application context either
      by-name or by-type. In addition, Spring Dynamic Modules defines the
